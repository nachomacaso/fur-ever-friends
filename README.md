## Fur Ever Friends

This is a coding assessment for Asana.  

I created a simple web application that displays an image gallery of dogs up for adoption. Users can view a gallery of thumbnails or open up a modal to view a particular full-sized image.

I decided to build this web application in React.  I'm accustomed to using bootstrap but I decided to use Material's components instead.  As far as styling, I have a single index.css file but I also tried to utilize Material's CSS-in-JS solution.  I also imported my own logo and favicon for this project.  My main focus was to make the site attractive and functional.  The gallery is dynamic and can support many listings.  All in all, I tried some new things on the fly and I'm proud at how it turned out.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
